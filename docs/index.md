## **Overview** 

This guide explains how to contribute to the Mech ecosystem by developing and offering services. Anyone can offer services by creating and deploying their own Mech agents. The process typically involves the following steps:

1. **Tool development**: Developers can either reuse existing tools (modular components of Mechs) or create and publish new ones.

2. **Agent deployment**: Once the necessary tools are ready, a Mech agent can be deployed and registered on the Olas Registry.

3. **Contract creation**: A Mech contract can then be created via the [Mech Marketplace](#appendix-what-is-the-mech-marketplace). When doing so, developers must choose a payment model that determines how requesters will pay for services.

There are three available payment models:

- **Native**: A fixed-price model where the requester pays in the chain’s native token for each delivered service.

- **Token**: Similar to the Native model, but payments are made using a specified ERC20 token.

- **Nevermined subscription**: A dynamic pricing model that enables flexible pricing and access to multiple services through a single subscription.

Detailed instructions for creating tools, testing them locally, deploying Mech agents, and receiving payments are provided below.
This guide contains guidelines for contributing to the development of the Mech Marketplace and offer services.
 
## 1. Creating and publishing a tool

In order to contribute to Mechs' abilities, you can create and publish a tool. In order to do so, follow the instructions below. 

**Requirements**:
  - [Python](https://www.python.org/) `>= 3.10`
  - [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) `>=1.4.0` 

### 1. 1. Creating a tool

In order to create a tool, the steps are as follows: 

**1.** Fork and clone the [mech-tools-dev](https://github.com/valory-xyz/mech-tools-dev) repository. 

- Option 1: Fork the repository from the GitHub page. Then, clone your fork using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/mech-tools-dev.git
```

- Option 2: Use GitHub's UI or its CLI tools:

```bash
gh repo fork https://github.com/valory-xyz/mech-tools-dev --clone=true
```

**2.** Install the dependencies, set up a remote registry, and fetch the third-party packages from IPFS.
You may use the following command after replacing the value for the `AUTHORNAME` variable:

```bash
AUTHORNAME=authorw

cd mech-tools-dev && \
poetry install && \
poetry run autonomy init --remote --ipfs --author $AUTHORNAME && \
poetry run autonomy packages sync --update-packages
```

**3.** Create the tool's structure by using the following command, after replacing the values for the `AUTHORNAME` and `TOOL_NAME` variables:

```bash
AUTHORNAME=author
TOOL_NAME=tool_name

TOOL_PATH=packages/"$AUTHORNAME"/customs/"$TOOL_NAME"
YEAR=$(date +"%Y")

mkdir -p $TOOL_PATH && \
cat > $TOOL_PATH/component.yaml <<EOF
name: $TOOL_NAME
author: $AUTHORNAME
version: 0.1.0
type: custom
description: Tool description
license: Apache-2.0
aea_version: '>=1.0.0, <2.0.0'
fingerprint:
    __init__.py:
    $TOOL_NAME.py:
fingerprint_ignore_patterns: []
entry_point: $TOOL_NAME.py
callable: run
dependencies: {}
EOF

for file in __init__.py "$TOOL_NAME.py"; do
  cat > $TOOL_PATH/$file <<EOF

EOF
done

cat >> "$TOOL_PATH/$TOOL_NAME.py" <<EOF
"""The implementation of the $TOOL_NAME tool."""


def run(*args, **kwargs):
    """The callable for the $TOOL_NAME tool."""
    # TODO: Implement the tool logic
    print(f"Running $TOOL_NAME with {args=} and {kwargs=}.")

EOF

poetry run autonomy packages lock
```

This command will generate the following structure, with template code:

```
packages/  
 ├── authorname/  
 │   ├── customs/  
 │   │   ├── tool_name/  
 │   │   │   ├── component.yaml
 │   │   │   ├── tool_name.py
 │   │   │   ├── __init__.py
```

**4.** Now that your tool's structure is set up, 
all that's left is to configure the tool component and implement the tool's functionality in Python.
The `component.yaml` file contains the tool's configuration. 
Here is an explanation of its fields:
- name: the name of the tool.
- author: the author's name.
- version: the version of the tool.
- type: the component type of the `open-autonomy` framework. This should be `custom`.
- description: the description of the tool.
- license: the licencing of the tool. It should be Apache-2.0.
- aea_version: the supported `open-aea` version.
- fingerprint: unique hash of the tool. This is auto-generated by the framework's `autonomy packages lock` command.
- fingerprint_ignore_patterns: ignore patterns for the fingerprint's generation.
- entry_point: the module which contains the tool's implementation.
- callable: points to the function which is called in the tool's module.
- dependencies: the module's dependencies. You may specify them in the following format:

```
dependencies:
    dependency_1:
        version: ==0.5.3
    dependency_2:
        version: '>=2.20.0'
```

### 1. 2. Publishing the tool

Before proceeding, make sure that you are inside the poetry environment:
```bash
poetry shell
```

**1.** Create the package hash, by running the following commands, from the root:

```bash
autonomy packages lock
```

At this point you will be prompted to choose "dev" or "third-part". Choose "dev".

**2.** Push the packages to IPFS: 

```bash
autonomy push-all
```

**3.** Mint the tool [here](https://registry.olas.network/ethereum/components/mint) as a component on the Olas Registry; 
For this is needed: an address (EOA), 
and the hash of the meta-data file. 
In order to generate this hash, 
click on “Generate Hash & File” and provide the following information: 
name (name of the tool); 
description (of the tool); 
version (this needs to match the version in the file `component.yaml`); 
package hash (this can be found in `packages.json` under the `packages` folder); 
NFT image URL (for instance on IPFS, supported domains are listed in the window). 
In order to push an image on IPFS, there are two options: 

- Use this [script](https://github.com/dvilelaf/tsunami/blob/v0.9.0/scripts/ipfs_pin.py). 
   Place the image in a folder called `mints` in `.jpg` format. 
   Then, run the script:
```bash
python ipfs_pin.py
```

- Use the [mech-client](https://github.com/valory-xyz/mech-client.git), 
   replacing `<file_name>` with the name of your file:
```bash
poetry add mech-client &&\
mechx push-to-ipfs ./<file_name>
```

After this the tool can be deployed to be used by a [Mech](#2-running-a-mech-locally). 


## 2. Running a Mech locally

In order to deploy a Mech agent, register it on the Mech Marketplace and run it locally in order to test your tools, you can use the [quickstart](https://github.com/valory-xyz/quickstart/blob/main/README.md).

<!-- Alternatively, you can follow the instructions below.

### 2.1 Creating a Mech service

To create the service, go to the [Olas Registry](https://registry.olas.network/gnosis/services) webpage. 

**1.** Select the appropriate network and connect your wallet.

**2.** Click the **"Mint"** button to begin service creation.

**3.** Fill in the service creation form as follows:

- Click **"Prefill address"** to automatically populate the **owner address** field.  
  Ensure this address has sufficient funds for deploying the service.

- For the **metadata hash**, click **"Generate Hash & File"**.  
  You should use the hash found in the `packages/packages.json` file of the [mech-predict repository](https://github.com/valory-xyz/mech-tools-dev/), under the key starting with `service/valory/mech/`.

- Select the appropriate prefix and paste the remaining part of the key into the field.  
  For example, if the full key is `service/valory/mech/0.1.0`, then the version is `0.1.0`.

- For the **Agent ID**, follow the instructions provided in the interface. (You can use Agent ID = `9` for testing purposes.)

- Set **Number of Slots** to the number of agents the service will use (we suggest `1` for testing).

- For **Agent bond cost**, enter a small value such as `1000000000000000` GörliWei (= 0.001 GörliETH).

- For **Threshold** to `1` for testing.

Once all fields are filled, click **"Submit"**.

**4.** Click the **"Services"** tab. Your newly created service will appear as the most recent entry. Click **"View"** to inspect it.

**5.** Complete the following three steps in order:

- **Step 1**: Click **"Activate Registration"**.

- **Step 2**: In the **"Agent Instance Addresses"** field, enter one address per agent (these must be distinct from the owner address), then click **"Register Agents"**.

- **Step 3**: Choose a **service multisig** and click **"Submit"**.

**6.** Your service is now deployed. 

You will see the address of the associated safe (multisig) contract — keep this address, as it is required for running the Mech.

### 2.2 Registering the service on the Mech Marketplace

In order to register your service on the Mech Marketplace, follow the instructions below.

**1.** Find [here](https://github.com/valory-xyz/ai-registry-mech/blob/v0.4.0/docs/configuration.json) the address of MechMarketPlaceProxy for the chosen network.

**2.** Using the scan of the chosen network, trigger the function `create` of this contract with the following inputs (in order):

- The service id.
- The Mech Factory address for the selected network and payment model. To find the correct address, refer to the [configuration file](https://github.com/valory-xyz/ai-registry-mech/blob/v0.4.0/docs/configuration.json). Search for the address that matches the chosen payment model:

    - For Native, look for the MechFactoryFixedPriceNative address.

    - For Token: MechFactoryFixedPriceToken address.

    - For Nevermined, find MechFactoryNvmSubscriptionNative.

- The maximum price of the Mech (also called maxDeliveryRate), converted to Wei. In order to do this, first multiply 
the price in xDAI by 10^18. For instance, for a price of 1 xDAI, this 
is equal to 10^18. Then Use [ABI Hashex Encoder](https://abi.hashex.org/). Select uint256 as the type and enter the obtained value (for 1 xDAI this is 1000000000000000000 in wei). The tool will generate the encoded result, which is the following in the example: 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000de0b6b3a7640000. Finally add 0x at the beginning of the sequence to obtain 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000de0b6b3a7640000 in the example. This is the sequence that should be entered. 


:warning: You must use the same EOA as the one used to deploy the service.

### 2.3 Running the Mech service

In order to run the Mech service that you created, use this repository. The steps are the same as in this [README.md](https://github.com/valory-xyz/mech-predict/blob/main/README.md#running-the-old-base-mech) (section 'Running the old base Mech').

## 3. How to accrue the payments

In order to accrue the payments of your Mech, find [here](https://github.com/valory-xyz/ai-registry-mech/blob/v0.4.0/docs/configuration.json) the BalanceTracker contract which corresponds to the payment model of your Mech. The key is the following for each of the three payment models: 

- Native: BalanceTrackerFixedPriceNative

- Token: BalanceTrackerFixedPriceToken

- Nevermined: BalanceTrackerNvmSubscriptionNative

Enter its address in the scan of the chosen network. Click on "Contract" and then "Write Contract" and trigger the function processPaymentByMultisig. Enter the address of your Mech and click on "Write". This will transfer the funds stored in the Mech Marketplace to the address of your Mech contract.  -->

## Appendix : What is the Mech Marketplace ?

The Mech Marketplace is a collection of smart contracts designed to facilitate seamless interactions between agents or applications (referred to as requesters) and Mech agents which provide task-based services. Essentially, it acts as a relay, enabling secure, on-chain payments while ensuring efficient task requests and service delivery. 

Specifically, the Mech Marketplace enables the following.

- **Effortless Mech contract creation and delivery**: Any agent registered on the Olas Service registry can quickly deploy a Mech contract with minimal inputs. This streamlined process allows agents to rapidly offer their service and receive on-chain payments.

- **Seamless task execution requests**: Requesters—whether agents or applications—can opt to directly submit service requests through the Mech Marketplace. The on-chain contracts manage payments, ensuring a smooth and transparent interaction between requesters and Mech agents.

- **Guaranteed task completion**: A take-over mechanism is in place: if a designated Mech fails to respond within a deadline specified by the requester, any other available Mech can step in to complete the task. Therefore, there is a high likelihood that every request is fulfilled, maintaining the system’s reliability.
Karma - A reputation score system: The Karma contract tracks each Mech’s performance by maintaining a reputation score. This reflects how often a Mech successfully completes assigned tasks versus how often it fails. Mech agents that maintain high Karma scores are considered more trustworthy by requesters. Assuming honest participation, Mech agents that maintain high Karma scores are considered more trustworthy by requesters.

- **Competitive environment**: Mechs are incentivized to deliver outstanding results promptly in order to maintain high Karma scores and secure more tasks.
